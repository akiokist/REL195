J Numbers

  And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.

  And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.

  And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.

  And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

  And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.

  And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.

  And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.

  And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.

  And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:   And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;   And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;   And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.

  And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

  The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

  And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.

  Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

  The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

  And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

  But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

  And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.

  And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.

  And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?   I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

  And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)   And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

  Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,   Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.

  And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,   The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.

  Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.

  And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:   But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.

  Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;   Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:   But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

  (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

  And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.

  And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

  Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.

  For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

  But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.

  Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

 of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:

 And they rose

  And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:   Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?   Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

  And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.

 tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.

  And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.

  If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.

  But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.

  And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:  And the earth opened her mouth,

  They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.

  And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

  And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:   How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:   And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:   Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.

  And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.

  And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.

  And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

  Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.

  And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

  And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.

  And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.

  And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,   Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.

  And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

  And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

  And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.

  For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

  Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:   For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.

  Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

  We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.

  Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

  And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

  And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.

  And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

  So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

  And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

  And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

  And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.

  And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

  And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.
