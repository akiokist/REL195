P Exodus

  And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.

  And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:   And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

 of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.

  And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:   And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

  And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

  And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

  Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:   And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

  And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

  And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.

  And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?   These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.

  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.

  And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

  The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.

  And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.

  And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.

  And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

  And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

  And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

  And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

  And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.

  And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

  And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

  Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.

  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.

  But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

  And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.

  And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.

  And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,   When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

  And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

  Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.

  For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

  And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

 And Moses and Aaron did so, as

 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

  And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

  And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:  And the river shall

  And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

  And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

  And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.

  But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

  And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

  And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

  And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

  And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

  And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,   This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.

  Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:   And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.

  Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:   And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

  And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

  And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

  Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

  And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

  And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

  For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.

  And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

  And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

  Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

  And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.

  And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.

  In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.

  Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.

  Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.

  And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

  Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

  And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

  It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

  And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:   But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

  A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

  In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.

  All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

  And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

  One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

  For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.

  And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.

 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

 And when

  And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:   But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.

  And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

  And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

 And Moses stretched out his hand

  And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

  And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

 And Moses stretched forth his hand

  And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

  But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

  And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:   And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:

  And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?   And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.

  And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.

  And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.

  And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

  And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.

  And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.

  This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.

  And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.

  And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.

  And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

  Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

  And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

  And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

  And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

  And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

  And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

  Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

  And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

  And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?   See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

  So the people rested on the seventh day.

  And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.

  And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

  And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.

  As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they

  Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

  In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.

  And God spake all these words, saying,   I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

  Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;   And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

  Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

  Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:   But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:   For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

  Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

  Thou shalt not kill.

  Thou shalt not commit adultery.

  Thou shalt not steal.

  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

 the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

  And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

  And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

 And Moses went into the

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.

  And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,   And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,   And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,   Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,   Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.

  And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

  According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.

  And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

  And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.

  And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

  And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

  Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.

  And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.

  And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

  Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.

  And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

  And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

  And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.

  Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

  And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.

  Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.

  The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure.

  And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.

  And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.

  And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.

  And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.

  And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits.

  The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three.

  And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three.

  And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four.

  All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of brass.

  The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass.

  All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.

  And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.

  In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.

  And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.

  And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty.

  And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

  And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

  And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.

  And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

  It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.

  And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

  And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:   Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.

  With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold.

  And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial.

  And thou shalt make ouches of gold;   And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.

  And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.

  Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

  And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.

  And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

  And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

  And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be set in gold in their inclosings.

  And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.

  And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen work of pure gold.

  And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

  And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.

  And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it.

  And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is in the side of the ephod inward.

  And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

  And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

  And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.

  And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.

  And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

  And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.

  And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:   A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

  And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not.

  And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

  And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

  And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

  And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of needlework.

  And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.

  And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

  And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:   And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.

  And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,   And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.

  And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

  And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.

  And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:   And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.

  Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.

  And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

  And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.

  And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

  And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

  And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.

  And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

  But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.

  Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

  And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

  And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.

  And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

  And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

  Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

  And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

  Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:   And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:   And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.

  And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

  And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.

  And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:   And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.

  And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

  And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.

  And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.

  And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

  And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.

  And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

  And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.

  And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.

  Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.

  Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.

  The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:   And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.

  And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

  This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.

  And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

  And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.

  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.

  And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.

  And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it.

  A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.

  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

  And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.

  And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.

  And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.

  And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

  And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.

  Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.

  And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.

  This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.

  Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.

  The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

  And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.

  For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:   When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:   So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.

  Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,   And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:   And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.

  And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,   And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,   And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.

  And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

  And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

  Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.

  Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

  And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:   And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:   And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

  And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

  Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:   And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,   To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,   And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

  And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;   The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,   And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,   And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,   And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,   And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.

  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

  Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

  It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

  And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

  And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.

  And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.

  And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.

  And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.

  And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.

  But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

  And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

  And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

  Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

  Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.

  And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,   Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,   And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,   And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,   And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,   And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

  And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;   The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,   The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering,   The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,   The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,   And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,   The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,   The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,   The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,   The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.

  And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

  And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

  And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

  And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

  Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

  And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

  And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.

  And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;   And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

  The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.

  And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;   And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;   And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,   And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

  And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

  Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.

  Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.

  And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:   And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.

  And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;   And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.

  And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.

  For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.

  And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.

  The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.

  And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

  And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

  Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.

  And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

  And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

  The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.

  And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.

  And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.

  And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.

  And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

  And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.

  The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.

  One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

  And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:   And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

  And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,   And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

  And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

  And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.

  And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.

  And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

  And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,   And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.

  And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.

  And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

  And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

  And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.

  And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;   And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.

  And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:   And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.

  And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.

  And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

  And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.

  And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

  And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;   One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

  And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

  And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:   And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.

  Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

  And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

  Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.

  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.

  And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold.

  And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:   And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:   Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.

  And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:   And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.

  Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.

  And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold.

  Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.

  And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.

  And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.

  And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.

  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

  And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

  And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.

  And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

  And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

  And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

  And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves.

  And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.

  And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.

  And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

  And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:   Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

  And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

  And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

  And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

  The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.

  And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.

  All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.

  And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.

  And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

  And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver.

  And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.

  This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.

  And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

  And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

  All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

  And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:   A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

  And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

  And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.

  And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.

  And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,   And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.

  And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

  And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

  They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.

  And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.

  And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

  It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.

  And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

  And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

  And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

  And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

  And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

  And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.

  And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

  And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.

  And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.

  And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.

  And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

  And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

  And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.

  And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

  And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;   A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,   And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,   And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

  And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

  And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,   And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,   The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,   The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,   The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,   And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,   The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,   The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,   The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.

  According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.

  And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

  And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.

  And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

  And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

  And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

  And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

  And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.

  And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

  And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.

  And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

  And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

  And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

  And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:   And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

  Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.

  And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

  And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.

  And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:   And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

  And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.

  And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

  And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:   And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

  And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

  And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:   When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.

  And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.

  Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

  And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

  And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:   But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.

  For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
