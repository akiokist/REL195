R Numbers

  These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

  And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.

  So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.

  And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

  At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

  And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.

  And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.

  And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

  Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

  At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

  And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

  Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,   And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:   Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.

  And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.

  Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

  And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

  And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD:   Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

  And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

  Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.

  According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.

  All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

  And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

  One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.

  One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,   Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

  Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.

  Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.

  And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,   Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;   Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

  And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:   And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.

  And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

  And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

  Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

  But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

  Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.

 So they gat up from the

 Then came the children of

  And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of

  And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

  And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

  From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

  From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

  Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,   And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

  And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.

  Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:   The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:   And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:   And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

  And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

  And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD:   And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.

  Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.

  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.

  And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.

  The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;   And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

  It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

  And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

  And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

  And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:   This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

  And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;   And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;   And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

  And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.

  And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

  And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD.

  And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

  In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein:   But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:   And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;   A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:   And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

  Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.

  After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

  And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.

  Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:   But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;   And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,   A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;   And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.
